# Antimatter-Annihilators

A game similiar to Space Invaders. The purpose of this project was to implement object-orientation, inheritance and polymorphism. As such, the gameplay mechanics are somewhat lacking and need work, should the game be really playable. However, as mentioned, game design wasn't so much the focus of the project - the project might just as well have been any other application, but games do have the benefit of making use of a variety of components such as graphics, sounds, user input/interaction, etc, and are thus well-suited to familiarise oneself with such features.
